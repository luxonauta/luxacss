## Open an issue

**✅ Always start by opening an issue.**

Always start this way; it will give other contributors and myself a chance to provide initial feedback, thoughts, and possible historical context.

It can also help you find others who might want to help you or even solve common problems.

When creating a issue, use the following labels:

- [`bug`](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/labels/bug) – There is a bug in my code. 😱
- [`docs`](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/labels/docs) – There are problems with the documentation site.
- [`enhancement`](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/labels/enhancement) – Issues were requesting a feature modification or extension.
- [`feature`](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/labels/feature) – Issues for requesting a new item.
- [`help-wanted`](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/labels/help-wanted) – In case you need help.
- [`meta`](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/labels/meta) – There are issues with the repository on GitHub.
- [`setup`](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/labels/setup) – There are issues related to the setup and build processes.

## Reporting bugs

> Reporting bugs is a great way to help! 🐛

If you've found a bug, please report it using the following guidelines (sticking to these guidelines helps me better understand the problem).

1.  [**Search for previous issues**](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) — Check that this issue has not already been reported.
2.  **What’s the problem?** — If the problem was not reported, explain what you are trying to do and what happened.
3.  **Provide an example** — A [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) that illustrates the problem is perfect. 💫
4.  **Describe what you've tried so far** — Understanding what you've tried so far will help me respond faster. Also include possible related issues that you read or explored.
5.  **Label your Issue as a `bug`** - This has already been said, but it's vital to keep everything organized!

## Feature requests

Have an idea on how to improve Luxa? There are a few ways to submit your crazy ideas! 🔥

Open a issue first. 😅

When opening an Issue, provide the following information:

1.  Proposed feature – What are you proposing? 🤔
2.  Why do you need it? - Is this necessary for the project? What is your timeline? Have you tried using other elements and components first?
3.  Provide examples - If you have examples of how others have solved this problem, please provide them so I can better understand what you are asking for.
4.  Who do you want to create this? - Are you building this, or do you want me to build it?
5.  Label your issue as a `feature`!

## Pull Requests

No Pull Request is too small or too early! I strive to provide early feedback promptly. 🚀

Adhering to the following process is the best way to include your contribution.

1.  Make sure you have the latest changes!
2.  Check out the dev branch and create a new topic branch for your feature, change, or fix.
3.  Commit your changes in logical blocks.
4.  Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream dev branch into your topic branch.
5.  Push your branch to the fork.
6.  [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxa/pulls) with a clear title and description.

> Note that all Pull Requests must be merged into the dev branch. Any pull request to the principal (main) will be rejected.

## General preferences

1.  Always use double quotes;
2.  Do not use [Shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties);
3.  Do not change the default extension (`.sass`).
4.  Use Luxa's modifier system.
