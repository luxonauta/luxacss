# Code of conduct

## Our compromise

In the interest of promoting an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, are committed to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our standards

Examples of behaviour that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Use a welcoming and inclusive language;
- Be respectful of different points of view and experiences;
- Graciously accept constructive criticism;
- Focus on what is best for the community;
- Demonstrate empathy towards other members of the community.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or images and unwanted sexual attention or advances;
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment;
- Publish private information of third parties, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional environment.

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

## Reach

This Code of Conduct applies in project spaces and public areas when an individual represents the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include:

- Using an official project email address;
- Publishing via an official social media account;
- Act as a nominated representative in an online or offline event;
- The representation of a project can be better defined and clarified by the project maintainers;

## Application

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by contacting the project team.

The project team will review and investigate all complaints and respond as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.

Project maintainers who do not follow or apply the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of project leadership.
